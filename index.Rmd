### Welcome!

<img src = "images/Adam.jpg" style = "width:30%; padding: 15px" align = "right">

My name is Adam Whalen (pronouns: he/him/his) and I am a Master of Public Health student at the [Columbia University Mailman School of Public Health](https://www.publichealth.columbia.edu/), studying Epidemiology and Applied Biostatistics. 

I'm interested in using robust analytical methods to investigate causal patterns of injury, violence, and disease along social, spatio-temporal, and political dimensions.
