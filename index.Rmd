### Welcome!

<img src = "images/Adam.jpg" style = "width:30%; padding: 15px" align = "right">

My name is Adam Whalen (pronouns: he/him/his) and I am a Master of Public Health graduate of the [Columbia University Mailman School of Public Health](https://www.publichealth.columbia.edu/) in Epidemiology and Applied Biostatistics. I am currently a data analyst at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine in the [Department of Epidemiology and Population Health](https://einsteinmed.edu/departments/epidemiology-population-health/). 

I'm interested in using robust analytical methods to investigate causal patterns of injury, violence, and disease along social, spatio-temporal, and political dimensions. 

I have experience using SAS, Stata, SQL, Microsoft Access, and R (how this website was built). My [CV](CV_08302022.pdf) has a more complete description of my professional background. 

For an example of data manipulation and visualization, please check out the NYC Restaurant Inspection analysis in [Plotly](plotly_restaurant.html) and the subsequent [Flex Dashboard](dashboard.html).
